On Tuesdays we would go down to the wharf for sandwiches.
I was the only one who didn't grow up next to the sea and I honestly didn't
know the difference between a wharf, a dock, a pier, and a harbor. 
And I was too scared to ask so I just said wharf like everyone else. 
What I did know is that there was plenty to eat. 
I like fish pretty well, it's best when it's deep fried. 
But I suppose that's the way with everything.  
So down at the wharf, we all ordered our sandwiches
and I tried something new. 
It was a disappointment and I considered sending it back. 
But in the end I didn't work up the courage and I picked at the bread
and stole french fries from Kayla. 
When we left, the other girls complained that they ate too much
and now they were going to get fat. 
I felt pretty good. And I had plenty of room for dessert.
