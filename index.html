On Tuesdays we would go down to the wharf for sandwiches.
They all said 'wharf' so naturally, they knew exactly what it meant. 
But I was the only one who wasn't from the sea and I honestly didn't
know the difference between a wharf, a dock, a pier, and a harbor. 
And I was too scared to ask so I just said wharf like everyone else. 
What I did know is that there was plenty to eat.
