When night came round we would light one lantern for upstairs
and one for downstairs
But the light never quite reached the corners, or the stairs
so as soon as someone needed to go up, they would light another lantern
to light the way.
This usually happened three or four times
and by the end of the night we had a half dozen lanterns lit
and it was all very light. 
I preferred it that way. Something about a well lighted lodge
made me feel safer in this dark and endless forest. 

Once there was a family with a small child who stayed 
in one of the cabins. 
The child had asthma, and one night around 9:00 or 10:00, she had an attack.
Her parents brought her inside, and they had a machine
they needed to turn on. 
This, of course, required electricity. 
I don't remember who ran out back to turn on the generator. 
It could have been me since, ironically, I'm the only one
not scared of the dark. 
Either way, as soon as the generator was on, 
the lodge was completely lit up. Lights over the counter, the dining tables, 
the lounge area, the kitchen, all on. It was so bright and beautiful 
and I felt so safe and warm. 
I felt insensitive for finding a good moment while a small child 
struggled to breath. So I never said anything about it, even though the 
girl was just fine after a few minutes. 
But in nights aftewards, I still imagined the lodge, 
lit up so brightly, casting all the darkness to the far reaches
of the woods.
