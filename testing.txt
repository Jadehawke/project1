When night came round we would light one lantern for upstairs
and one for downstairs
But the light never quite reached the corners, or the stairs
so as soon as someone needed to go up, they would light another lantern
to light the way.
This usually happened three or four times
and by the end of the night we had a half dozen lanterns lit
and it was all very light. 
I preferred it that way. Something about a well lighted lodge
made me feel safer in this dark and endless forest.
