*Fish Sticks
**One family's adventure in fishing

When I was a girl we rarely went fishing. My mother had already decided it was a waste of time.
We didn't even eat fish.
So one time we tromped up to Payson Lake with our fishing gear, and made our way around the shore to find the perfect spot.
We came across another group of fishermen who were just wrapping up, and they told us,
"The fishing is great here."
We thanked them and moved into their spot as they left.
